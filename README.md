![Augment LLM Capabilities with MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranfysvalle02/blog-drafts/main/blog-flow.png)

In the dynamic landscape of investment management, real-time transaction data is your most powerful ally. A single bad decision can have a ripple effect felt throughout your entire portfolio. Unlocking the actionable insights buried within raw transactional data holds the key to making sound, strategic investment decisions. This blog post will explore how [MongoDB's Aggregation Framework](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/introduction-aggregation-framework/) and GenAI can work together to transform your data analysis workflow.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized our interaction with computers, providing capabilities such as drafting emails, writing poetry, and even engaging in human-like conversations. However, when it comes to dealing with complex data processing and mathematical calculations, LLMs have their limitations.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language, they lack the ability to understand and manipulate numbers or symbols in the same way. Additionally, LLMs rely on a limited context window for processing information, and cannot directly access database systems.

That's where MongoDB's Aggregation Framework shines, offering an efficient and powerful solution for complex data analysis tasks. It allows you to process entire collections of data, passing it through a multi-stage data pipeline. Within these stages, you can perform calculations and transformations on entire collections. This bypasses the limitations of LLMs for numerical computations, providing a robust and reliable method for data analysis.

In this blog post, we’ll combine the power of the MongoDB Aggregation framework with GenAI to overcome the limitations of “Classic RAG”. We'll explore this by delving into the MongoDB Atlas Sample Dataset, specifically the `sample_analytics` database. The transaction data offers a realistic dataset that allows users to hone their skills in data analysis, querying, and aggregation, particularly in the context of financial data.

### Explanation of the `sample_analytics` documents
Collection: transactions

- transaction_id: This is a unique identifier that distinctly marks each transaction.
- account_id: This field establishes a connection between the transaction and its corresponding account.
- date: This represents the precise date and time at which the transaction took place.
- transaction_code: This indicates the nature of the transaction, such as a deposit, withdrawal, buy, or sell.
- symbol: If relevant, this field denotes the symbol of the stock or investment involved in the transaction.
- amount: This reflects the value of the transaction.
- total: This captures the comprehensive transacted amount, inclusive of quantities, fees, and any additional charges associated with the transaction.

**The Power of Transactional Data**

Stock transaction data offers a wealth of information for investment researchers and analysts. By carefully examining patterns within this data, you can:

* **Identify Trends:** Spot emerging market movements and potential shifts in investor sentiment.
* **Uncover Hidden Opportunities:** Discover undervalued stocks or sectors poised for growth.
* **Manage Risk:** Assess the volatility of specific holdings and make informed decisions about asset allocation for optimal risk-return balance.

### The Task: Investment Performance Analysis

Consider a scenario where we need to determine the return on investment (ROI) for each stock over a certain period. This task involves filtering the sales by product, calculating the ROI, and then sorting these to find the stocks with the highest returns. Traditional methods like SQL or application code processing can be complex and inefficient, especially with large datasets.

In SQL, this would require multiple subqueries, temporary tables, and joins - a complex and potentially inefficient process, especially with large datasets. With application code, you would need to retrieve all the data first, calculate the ROI, and then perform the sorting, which could be resource-intensive.

Navigating these complexities can be made more efficient by harnessing the power of MongoDB's Aggregation Framework, combined with the intelligent capabilities of AI technologies like CrewAI and Large Language Models (LLMs). This potent combination not only streamlines the process but also uncovers deeper insights from our data.

**Benefits**

* **Informed Decision-Making:**  ROI analysis provides a clear metric for evaluating the success of past investments. This data empowers investors, from individuals to large institutions, to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding specific stocks.
* **Portfolio Optimization:**  Identifying high and low-performing stocks is crucial for adjusting your investment mix. You might shift investments towards top-performing assets or re-evaluate underperforming ones.
* **Identifying Trends:** Analyzing ROI over time can reveal trends within individual stocks or broader market sectors. Recognizing these patterns helps investors anticipate potential opportunities or risks.
* **Benchmarking:** Comparing your portfolio's ROI to relevant market indices helps gauge how your investments are performing relative to the overall market.
* **Tax Implications:** In many jurisdictions, calculating the ROI of investments plays a role in determining capital gains or losses, impacting tax calculations.

### The Solution: MongoDB's Aggregation Framework

![MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranfysvalle02/blog-drafts/main/xa1.png)

The MongoDB Aggregation Framework provides a powerful data processing pipeline where documents are transformed to produce aggregated results. By executing complex calculations and data manipulations directly on the server-side, it significantly reduces the volume of data that needs to be transferred across the network. This optimization is crucial when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) - specially those that are hosted remotely like OpenAI.

LLMs excel at understanding and generating human-like text, but they can be constrained by the size of their context window (the amount of input text they can process at once). Preprocessing and aggregating data with MongoDB's Aggregation Framework effectively shrinks the dataset that needs to be fed to the LLM.

By moving the math and the data aggregation to MongoDB, you can leverage the LLM's language capabilities for high-value tasks like:

* **Generating insightful summaries and interpretations:** Summarizing pre-aggregated trends identified by MongoDB.
* **Crafting compelling narratives:**  Turning  data points into engaging business reports.
* **Answering complex questions about the data:**  The LLM can combine its understanding of the processed data with external knowledge to provide richer answers.
 
MongoDB's Aggregation Framework provides an efficient and straightforward solution for this complex analysis. Here's how you could write the query:

```javascript
[
  {
	"$unwind": "$transactions"
  },
  {
	"$group": {
  	"_id": "$transactions.symbol",
  	"buyValue": {
    	"$sum": {
      	"$cond": [
        	{ "$eq": ["$transactions.transaction_code", "buy"] },
        	{ "$toDouble": "$transactions.total" },
        	0
      	]
    	}
  	},
  	"sellValue": {
    	"$sum": {
      	"$cond": [
        	{ "$eq": ["$transactions.transaction_code", "sell"] },
        	{ "$toDouble": "$transactions.total" },
        	0
      	]
    	}
  	}
	}
  },
  {
	"$project": {
  	"_id": 0,
  	"symbol": "$_id",
  	"returnOnInvestment": { "$subtract": ["$sellValue", "$buyValue"] }
	}
  },
  {
	"$sort": { "returnOnInvestment": -1 }
  }
]
```

This MongoDB Aggregation Framework pipeline is composed of multiple stages, each performing a specific operation on the data:

1. `$unwind`: This stage deconstructs an array field from the input documents to output a document for each element. Here we're unwinding the `transactions` array.

2. `$group`: This stage groups input documents by a specified identifier expression and applies the accumulator expression(s) to each group. We're grouping by `transactions.symbol` and calculating the `buyValue` and `sellValue` for each group.

3. `$project`: This stage reshapes each document in the stream by renaming, adding, or removing fields, as well as creating computed values and sub-documents. We're projecting the `symbol` and `returnOnInvestment` (calculated by subtracting `buyValue` from `sellValue`) fields.

4. `$sort`: This stage reorders the document stream by a specified sort key. We're sorting the documents by `returnOnInvestment` in descending order.

This pipeline calculates the total buy and sell values for each stock, and then calculates the return on investment by subtracting the total buy value from the total sell value. The stocks are then sorted by return on investment in descending order, so the stocks with the highest returns are at the top.

To run this query, you'll need access to a MongoDB instance with the sample data. 

Here's a simple way to run it using pymongo, a Python driver for MongoDB:

```python
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/test") 
db = client["sample_analytics"]
collection = db["transactions"]

pipeline = [
  {
	"$unwind": "$transactions"
  },
  {
	"$group": {
  	"_id": "$transactions.symbol",
  	"buyValue": {
    	"$sum": {
      	"$cond": [
        	{ "$eq": ["$transactions.transaction_code", "buy"] },
        	{ "$toDouble": "$transactions.total" },
        	0
      	]
    	}
  	},
  	"sellValue": {
    	"$sum": {
      	"$cond": [
        	{ "$eq": ["$transactions.transaction_code", "sell"] },
        	{ "$toDouble": "$transactions.total" },
        	0
      	]
    	}
  	}
	}
  },
  {
	"$project": {
  	"_id": 0,
  	"symbol": "$_id",
  	"returnOnInvestment": { "$subtract": ["$sellValue", "$buyValue"] }
	}
  },
  {
	"$sort": { "returnOnInvestment": -1 }
  }
]

results = list(collection.aggregate(pipeline))
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

The result will be a list of documents, each representing a unique stock, and containing the return on investment for that stock.

```
{'symbol': 'amzn', 'returnOnInvestment': 72769230.71428967}
{'symbol': 'sap', 'returnOnInvestment': 39912931.04990542}
{'symbol': 'aapl', 'returnOnInvestment': 25738882.292086124}
{'symbol': 'adbe', 'returnOnInvestment': 17975929.726718843}
{'symbol': 'bb', 'returnOnInvestment': 12396285.970310092}
{'symbol': 'amd', 'returnOnInvestment': 7910082.824741647}
{'symbol': 'csco', 'returnOnInvestment': 5688005.834037811}

{'symbol': 'fb', 'returnOnInvestment': 1100046.9410015345}
{'symbol': 'znga', 'returnOnInvestment': 208171.51880900562}
{'symbol': 'team', 'returnOnInvestment': -406507.08118489385}
{'symbol': 'nflx', 'returnOnInvestment': -2133963.99949342}
{'symbol': 'intc', 'returnOnInvestment': -7407861.202953339}
{'symbol': 'crm', 'returnOnInvestment': -15106640.203961253}
{'symbol': 'msft', 'returnOnInvestment': -15665720.737709165}
{'symbol': 'ibm', 'returnOnInvestment': -18356948.23498428}
{'symbol': 'goog', 'returnOnInvestment': -168114276.91805267}
```

This approach leverages MongoDB's Aggregation Framework to perform complex data analysis tasks efficiently, directly within the database, without requiring extensive data transfer or additional processing in the application code.

### Analysis

The data presented above provides a snapshot of the return on investment (ROI) for various tech stocks.

The top performers in terms of ROI are Amazon (AMZN), SAP, and Apple (AAPL), with impressive returns of 72.7 million, 39.9 million, and 25.7 million respectively. These companies have demonstrated consistent growth and profitability, making them attractive to investors.

On the other end of the spectrum, we see negative returns for companies like Atlassian (TEAM), Netflix (NFLX), Intel (INTC), Salesforce (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM, and Google (GOOG). This indicates a loss on the investments made in these stocks. The most significant loss was incurred by Google, with a negative return of 168.1 million.

**Supercharging Insights with AI**

The aggregation framework lays the groundwork, but we can take our analysis a step further with AI. Imagine an AI assistant that can:

* **Summarize Trends:**  Get concise summaries of complex data patterns calculated by MongoDB.
* **Link to External News:** Connect market trends with real-time news on companies you're invested in.
* **Answer Complex Questions:** Ask questions about the dataset and get responses that combine the data with insights from the wider financial world.

_**note**: Python version used during development was: 3.10.10_

### The Code

In this section, we'll walk through the Python code used to perform financial analysis based on transaction data stored in MongoDB, using Azure OpenAI and Google Search API for data analysis and insights.

### MongoDB Setup

First, we set up a connection to MongoDB using pymongo. This is where our transaction data is stored. We'll be performing an aggregation on this data later.

```python
import os
import pymongo

MDB_URI = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/"
client = pymongo.MongoClient(MDB_URI)
db = client["sample_analytics"]
collection = db["transactions"]
```

### Azure OpenAI Setup

Next, we set up our connection to Azure OpenAI. Azure OpenAI can be replaced by your preferred LLM.

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI

AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://__DEMO__.openai.azure.com"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = "__AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY__" 
deployment_name = "gpt-4-32k"  # The name of your model deployment
default_llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    openai_api_version=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_VERSION", "2023-07-01-preview"),
    azure_deployment=deployment_name,
    azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
    api_key=AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
)
```

### Google Search API Setup

We're also going to use the Google Search API. This will be used by our "researcher" agent to find relevant financial data and news articles.

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import GoogleSerperAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import Tool

search = GoogleSerperAPIWrapper(serper_api_key='__API_KEY__')
search_tool = Tool(
        name="Google Answer",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to ask with search"
    )
```

### CrewAI Setup

We'll be using CrewAI to manage our agents and tasks. In this case, we have one agent - a researcher who is tasked with analyzing the data and providing actionable insights.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process, Task, Agent

researcher = Agent(
  role='Investment Researcher',
  goal="""
  Research market trends, company news, and analyst reports to identify potential investment opportunities.
  """,
  verbose=True,
  llm=default_llm,
  backstory='Expert in using search engines to uncover relevant financial data, news articles, and industry analysis.',
  tools=[search_tool]
)

analysis_task = Task(
  description="""
Using the following information:

[VERIFIED DATA]
{agg_data}

*note*
The data represents the average price of each stock symbol for each transaction type (buy/sell),
and the total amount of transactions for each type. This would give us insight into the average costs and proceeds from each stock,
as well as the volume of transactions for each stock.
[END VERIFIED DATA]

[TASK]
- Provide a financial summary of the VERIFIED DATA
- Research current events and trends, and provide actionable insights and recommendations
  """,
  agent=researcher,
  expected_output='concise markdown financial summary and list of actionable insights and recommendations',
  tools=[search_tool],
)

tech_crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher],
  tasks=[analysis_task],
  process=Process.sequential
)
```

### MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline

Next, we define our MongoDB aggregation pipeline. This pipeline is used to process our transaction data and calculate the return on investment for each stock symbol.

```python
pipeline = [
  {"$unwind": "$transactions"},
  {"$group": {
      "_id": "$transactions.symbol",
      "buyValue": {
        "$sum": {
          "$cond": [
            { "$eq": ["$transactions.transaction_code", "buy"] },
            { "$toDouble": "$transactions.total" },
            0
          ]
        }
      },
      "sellValue": {
        "$sum": {
          "$cond": [
            { "$eq": ["$transactions.transaction_code", "sell"] },
            { "$toDouble": "$transactions.total" },
            0
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {"$project": {
      "_id": 0,
      "symbol": "$_id",
      "returnOnInvestment": { "$subtract": ["$sellValue", "$buyValue"] }
    }
  },
  {"$sort": { "returnOnInvestment": -1 }}
]
results = list(collection.aggregate(pipeline))
client.close()

print("MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Results:")
print(results)
```

### Task Execution

Finally, we kick off our task execution. The researcher agent will use the data from our MongoDB aggregation, as well as any other tools at their disposal, to analyze the data and provide insights.

```python
tech_crew.kickoff(inputs={'agg_data': str(results)})
```

```

### Limitations and Considerations

While the combination of MongoDB's Aggregation Framework and GenAI represents a powerful tool for data analysis and interpretation, it's important to recognize a few potential limitations:

1. **Dependence on Historical Data:** Past performance may not always predict future results, especially in unpredictable markets where unforeseen events can significantly impact investment outcomes.

2. **Uncertainty in Predictions:** Despite the sophistication of the analysis, there will always be an inherent degree of uncertainty in investment predictions. Future outcomes are inherently unknowable, and factors beyond the scope of historical data can influence results.

3. **LLM Limitations:** LLMs are still evolving, and their ability to interpret and analyze financial data is continually improving. However, biases in training data or limitations in the model's architecture could lead to inaccurate or misleading insights.

By being aware of these limitations and taking steps to mitigate them, you can ensure a more responsible and well-rounded approach to investment analysis.
